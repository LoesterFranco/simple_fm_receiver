Do not edit files in directory export directly
but changes in source directory then use ALLIANCE tools
to analyze and sintesis them.

there is three test bench the first (e.g modelsim-bench) is for quick test
e.g just hit run -all then this will test in one loop
other can be used for modifying clock signal and 
applying reset signal to fm.
directory layout:
	source => contain source code development (primary source)
	export => contain VHDL and VERILOG exportable code that can
		  be used on many synthesize tools.
	docs   => contains documents for reports
	bench  => the test bench clock and reset can be modified
	bench_xil => test bench for Xilinx, this because Xilinx uses
	          std_logic for signal in synthesized component.
	modelsim-bench => quick test bench the clock and reset signal is
		  supplied by testbench (the old one). 

NOTES: the report is better displayed on postscript than pdf format
       this is may be because the dvipdf driver not produces good pdf file.
       if you have ghostview or any postscript viewer see the postscript 
       file to get the best view.
